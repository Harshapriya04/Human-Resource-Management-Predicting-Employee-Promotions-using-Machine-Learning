# Human-Resource-Management-Predicting-Employee-Promotions-using-Machine-Learning
**Project Overview**
This project develops a data-driven system to predict the likelihood of an employee being promoted within an organization. It addresses the critical challenge of subjectivity and bias in traditional Human Resource (HR) promotion processes, which can lead to missed talent and high attrition.

By leveraging machine learning, this application provides HR managers with an objective, real-time score of an employee's promotion readiness, shifting talent management from a reactive checklist to a proactive, strategic tool for growth and retention.

**Key Features**
Objective Prediction: Utilizes the Random Forest Classifier to generate a quantifiable probability score based on objective data (KPIs, tenure, training scores).
Bias Mitigation: Employs the SMOTE technique during training to handle the class imbalance (low promotion rate), ensuring the model is fair and robust.
Three-Tier Architecture: Structured into Data, Application (Flask), and Presentation tiers for scalability and maintainability.
Real-Time Scoring: Deployed as a lightweight Flask web application for instant prediction after user input.

**Solution and Technical Architecture**
Our solution is centered around the Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble machine learning model selected for its high accuracy, stability, and robust handling of complex, non-linear employee data. The entire system is structured as a three-tier, decoupled architecture. The Data Tier handles all analytical processing, including comprehensive data cleaning, visualization, and crucially, using the SMOTE technique to manage the severe class imbalance inherent in promotion datasets. Once trained, the model is serialized using joblib.

The application is deployed using a lightweight Flask web framework, which serves as the Application Tier (middleware). This server loads the pre-trained model into memory and acts as a prediction API. The Presentation Tier, a simple HTML/CSS interface, allows HR personnel to input an employee's current features. The system then processes the input in real-time and instantly returns an objective probability score (Promoted/Not Promoted), offering immediate, data-backed insights for advancement decisions.

**Strategic Impact**
By implementing this predictive solution, organizations gain a strategic tool for talent retention and scalability. The system provides a transparent and quantifiable score for promotion readiness, eliminating personal bias and ensuring fair recognition of achievement. This leads directly to higher employee engagement and commitment. Furthermore, the automation of the initial screening process significantly reduces managerial time and resources, making the talent review process more efficient and easily scalable across large departments.
